This is my first foray into Spring, Springboot and the dark side of Java.

Description:

A simple program that allows basic CRUD operations with Employee entities. The 'novelty' stems from the fact that it uses the Spring Framework and has an in-memory database.
Made with the help of Udemy courses & hours of googling.

Technologies used:
1. IntelliJ Idea
2. Spring Framework
3. Springboot
4. Maven
5. POSTMAN
6. JPA (Java Persistence API)
7. H2
